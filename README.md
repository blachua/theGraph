# the Graph

The Graph is a decentralized query protocol and indexing service for the blockchain. It allows developers to easily track events being emitted from smart contracts on various networks, and write custom data transformation scripts, which are run in real time. The data is also made available through a simple GraphQL API which developers can then use to display things on their frontends.
